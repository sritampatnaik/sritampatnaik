### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I run Lowercase Labs, a web developement studio based out of Singapore. 

Some of the things we've built: 
- [Edify](https://edify.ink/) - SaaS app for running cohort-based courses
- [Techtok](https://techtok.dev/) - Software engineering talent marketplace
- [Remote Internships](https://remoteinternships.io/#/) - Remote internships job board

I also teach web development at [Skills Union](skillsunion.com).    

I'm looking to work with founders of early/mid tier startups who are in a high-growth phase. 

Projects that get me excited:
- No-code software _Eg: Bubble, Webflow, Airtable_
- Low-code dev tools _Eg: Retool, Vercel, Netlify_
- High-quality coding education
- Business-in-a-box softwares

So, if you are building the next Shopify, Airtable or Retool. I would love to work with you.
